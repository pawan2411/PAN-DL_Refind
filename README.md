## Abstract

Relation extraction (RE) has achieved remarkable progress with the help of pre-trained language models. However, existing RE models are usually incapable of handling two situations: implicit expressions and long-tail relation classes, caused by language complexity and data sparsity. Further, these approaches and models are largely inaccessible to users who donâ€™t have direct access to large language models (LLMs) and/or infrastructure for supervised training or fine-tuning. Rule-based systems also struggle with implicit expressions. Apart from this, Real world financial documents such as various 10-X reports (including 10-K, 10-Q, etc.) of publicly traded companies pose another challenge to rule-based systems in terms of longer and complex sentences. In this paper, we introduce a simple approach that consults training relations at test time through a nearest-neighbor search over dense vectors of lexico-syntactic patterns and provides a simple yet effective means to tackle the above issues. We evaluate our approach on REFinD and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further show that it can provide a good start for human in the loop setup when a small number of annotations are available and it is also beneficial when domain experts can provide high quality patterns.

## Patterns

## Setup
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. run Refind_index_train to create embeddings and index train file.
3. run Refind_index_query to create embeddings and index test file.
4. evaluate.py run top k match algo for each query embed with fallback evaluation for no template found case with f1 score calculation. [see-paper-for-details]
NOTE: for pattern templates mentioned in paper see comments in parse_str method in both 2,3 point files.
